=head1 NAME

Plack::App::URLHashMap - Map multiple apps in different paths

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Plack::App::URLHashMap;
 
    my $app1 = sub { ... };
    my $app2 = sub { ... };
 
    my $urlmap = Plack::App::URLMap->new;

    $urlmap->map( '/'    => $app1 );
    $urlmap->map( '/foo' => $app2 );
 
    my $app = $urlmap->to_app;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This PSGI application is a simpler alternative to L<Plack::App::URLMap>.

It dispatches requests to different apps by looking up C<PATH_INFO> in a hash.

=head1 CAVEATS

This application requires exact matching, /foo and /foo/ are different paths,
as such you will need two entries if you want both to work. This works similar
to a location = block in nginx.
